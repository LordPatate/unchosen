# The Unchosen

A fantasy novel about a chosen one, and its "unchosen" twin.

Written by Tom Bricaud in French.

## Plot summary

About once every 80 years, a child is born with the ability to harness some of the powers of Nature.
They are named "the chosen one" and rapidly becomes a pillar of the society it was born in.
However, every "chosen one" always has a twin, a counterpart, a reflection.

This "twin" is not born from the same mother, but they do share the same birth date.
They resemble each other like actual twins would, with the notable exception that the "unchosen one" is powerless.
It is widely believed that, in order to find balance, the chosen one must find its "twin" and bond with them.

In this story, however, the unchosen one always actively rejected his chosen counterpart.
